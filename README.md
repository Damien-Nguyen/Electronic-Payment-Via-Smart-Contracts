# Project-3

Development of Electronic Payment System Using Smart Contract

## Goal

The project team work together to develop a paymwent smart contract to facilitate each transaction of money transfer;

## Functions of Product

* Develop a payment system using smart contract to settle transactions;
* Each transaction is recorded on a smart contract and done via this smart contract;
* Let's say Damien wants to sell a product to Luis for $10;
* Damien uses the developed payment system to enter the dollar values for Luis to pay via that system;
* Damien is allowed to link his account to the system and all the payment will be deposited to his account via the function of the smart contract;
* Luis can enter his account into the smart contract to transfer the $10 to Damien account via this smart contract;
* In the end, both Damien and Luis are able to view the balances of their respective accoutn to confirm the completion of the transaction without errors;
* Transactions use Etherum (wei or ether) as medium to conduct the money exchange and then exchange the ether or wei back to the actual dollar values. 
* Each side shoudl have records of their dollar values. When a transaction is needed, certain amount of dollars need to be exchanged to ether or wei automatically. The ether or wei then will be sent to the seller by the buyer to make the payment. 
* The seller account receives the ether or wei and then exchange them into dollar value whcih is added to his account balance.
